# Network Sniffer Tool

## Overview

The **Network Sniffer Tool** is a Python-based application designed to capture, analyze, and monitor network traffic in real-time. It enables users to intercept data packets transmitted over a network, providing deep insights into network activity. This tool is useful for network administrators, cybersecurity professionals, and enthusiasts for network troubleshooting, performance monitoring, or security analysis.

## Features

- **Real-time Packet Capture**: Captures incoming and outgoing network packets in real-time, allowing for immediate monitoring of network activity.
- **Protocol Analysis**: Identifies various protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, etc.) and provides detailed information about packet headers and payloads.
- **Custom Filters**: Supports filtering by IP address, protocol, port, or packet type to focus on specific traffic patterns or sources.
- **Data Logging**: Saves captured packets to log files for later analysis, including timestamps for each packet.
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works on any system with Python installed, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- **Stealth Mode**: Can operate silently, capturing data without alerting network users, making it useful for security audits.
- **Simple Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Easy to use, with a command-line interface for configuring and running the sniffer.
- **Packet Decryption (optional)**: With additional configuration, the tool can attempt to decrypt captured packets (depending on the encryption method and key availability).

## Use Cases

- **Network Troubleshooting**: Diagnose network issues by capturing and analyzing the traffic between devices on the network.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor network performance by observing packet transmission, delays, and packet drops.
- **Security Audits**: Capture and analyze network traffic to detect potential security threats such as unauthorized access or malicious traffic.
- **Cybersecurity Training**: Use the tool to understand network traffic and practice ethical hacking techniques.
- **Forensics**: Capture evidence of network-based attacks or unauthorized access for investigation.

## How It Works

1. **Packet Capture**:
   - The tool captures raw packets using the system's network interface.
   - It intercepts traffic across various protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, and more.

2. **Protocol Parsing**:
   - The tool parses packet headers and payloads to extract key information, such as source/destination IP, port numbers, protocol type, and packet size.
   - Supports deep packet inspection for detailed analysis.

3. **Filtering**:
   - Users can apply filters to capture specific traffic, such as packets from/to a particular IP address, using a specific protocol, or on a designated port.

4. **Logging**:
   - All captured packets can be saved into log files for further analysis.
   - Option to timestamp packets for precise tracking of when network events occur.

5. **Stealth Mode (optional)**:
   - The tool can be run in stealth mode, where it silently monitors network traffic without drawing attention from network users or administrators.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `scapy` (for packet capture and analysis)
  - `argparse` (for handling command-line arguments)

You can install these dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ritesh-r99/network-sniffer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd network-sniffer-tool
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Sniffer

To start capturing packets on the default network interface:

```bash
python network-sniffer.py
```

You can also specify the network interface and apply filters for more targeted sniffing:

```bash
python network-sniffer.py --interface <interface_name> --filter <filter_condition>
```

### Example:

Capture traffic on interface `eth0` and filter only TCP packets:

```bash
python network-sniffer.py --interface eth0 --filter "tcp"
```

### Packet Logging

To save the captured packets to a log file for later analysis:

```bash
python network-sniffer.py --logfile packets.log
```

## Filters and Options

- **Protocol Filtering**: Capture specific protocol traffic (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
- **Port Filtering**: Monitor specific ports (e.g., `--filter "port 80"` for HTTP traffic).
- **IP Filtering**: Capture traffic to/from specific IP addresses.
- **Log Format**: Configure how logs are saved, including options to log packet headers, payloads, or full packet data.

## Security & Ethical Guidelines

- **Authorized Use Only**: This tool is intended for ethical purposes, such as personal monitoring, network troubleshooting, and security auditing. Unauthorized interception of network traffic is illegal in most regions and violates privacy laws.
- **Consent**: Ensure that you have proper authorization to monitor the network on which this tool is being used. Always obtain explicit consent from users when monitoring a shared network.
- **Secure Log Handling**: Protect log files and captured data to prevent unauthorized access, especially when dealing with sensitive or personal information.
